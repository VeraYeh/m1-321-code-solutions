      <h1>It's the foundation for patient- centered primary care.</h1>
      <p>
        Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care acrosss
        clinicians, staff, and patients themselves -- making you more
        productive, less streesed, and adding just a bit more joy into
        your practice of medicine.

      <p>You don't have to click a dozen times to order a flu shot or
        bounce around five windows to discover the last blood count.
        Canvas pulls everything you need directly into your note, so
        you never have to leave it. And because Canvas learns from
        every interaction, it gets smarter with every patients you see.

        dramatically on key quality metrics, and is incredibly easy to use.
        The right information is presented in the right way at the right
        time, and the product leverages technology to actually improve
        the quality of care I provided."

        potentially unsafe levels of opioids according to the most recent

        tremendously important questions. But I just couldn't get and answer

      <h1>It automates performance improvement</h1>
      <p>Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you understand
        performance, but they aren't enough to improve quality and increase
        revenue day after day. Canvas automates quality protocols and charge
        capture so clinicians can focus on more complex work only they can do.

      <blockquote>"With MIPS a reality and fee-for-service billing rules as complex
        as ever, to be honest I didn't know how we were going to keep up. We're
        a small practice and we don't have a big quality team or a group of
        coders to catch everything. The automation in Canvas has completely
        eliminated my concerns around quality and revenue performance."
